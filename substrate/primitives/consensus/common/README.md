# Common Consensus Primitives

This crate is part of the [Polkadot SDK](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/).

## About

This crate contains common utilities for building and using consensus engines in Substrate.
Much of this crate is _unstable_ and thus the API is likely to undergo
change. Implementors of traits should not rely on the interfaces to remain
the same.
Together with other crates, it forms the [Substrate](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/tree/master/substrate) framework.
